# Module 7 - Programming Assignment 10 - Problem 1

**Sepecification**

Use the sentinel pattern as described in Canvas and the text.

Write a program that asks the user for numbers, and provides the sum of the numbers when finished.

Valid numbers are non-negative. The user signals the end of the list by entering a negative number.

**Lecture notes:**
sentienal = while loop

set user input to 0
while input> 0 go through loop
if negative number is inputted it will end loop because the loop only repeats with positive numbers
